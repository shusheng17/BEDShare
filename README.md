# BEDShare

A Blockchain-based Searchable Encryption

This project gives the python 3.8 implementation of a efficient searchable encryption algorithm for data sharing.

**DataContract.sol** is the smart contract we created and is deployed on the blockchain.

**BEDShare.py** is built for data sharing, which includes setup, update, authorization, search processes, etc.

**Test_BEDShare.py** is used to verify the reliability of the algorithms in BEDShare.
